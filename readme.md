# Machine Learning Zoomcamp 2022
## Capstone 1 - Pistachio Image Classifier

The presente project was elaborated as the Capstone 1 project, for the [Machine Learning Zooncamp 2022](https://github.com/alexeygrigorev/mlbookcamp-code/tree/master/course-zoomcamp) realized by [Datacamp.club](https://datatalks.club/).

The objective of this project, is to develop an machine learning model for classificate images of pistachios, and determine to wich variety belongs.

For this, I propose to build and train a deep learning model, taking a dataset of pistachios varieties as training data for the model.
